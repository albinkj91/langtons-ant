# Langton's Ant
User interactive implementation of Langton's Ant. Langton's Ant is a cellular automaton where a simulated ant moves and colors tiles according to a predefined rule set. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant

# Input instructions
Rules: Enter a combination of L's and R's for the ants movement (example: LRRL). To choose from a predefined rule set, press the down-key when the first input field is selected.  
Steps: Amount of steps per interval (Speed of ant).  
Start X: The starting x-position of the ant.  
Start Y: The starting y-position of the ant.  
Tile Width: The width of the tiles on the drawing area. (Must be adapted to the starting X and Y positions or ant will start out of bounds.
